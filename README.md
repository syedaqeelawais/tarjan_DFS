# tarjan_DFS
#Implementation of Tarjan’s algorithm using depth-first search (DFS) for finding strongly connected components (SCC) in a graph. 
This is the standard algorithm for finding the strongly connected components in a graph.
It uses two indexes,
	1. disc[v]   determines the discovery time of a vertex
	2. low[v]    determines the low time for the vertex
Depth First search(DFS) is used for searching.
