# tarjan_DFS
#Implementation of Tarjanâ€™s algorithm using depth-first search (DFS) for finding strongly connected components (SCC) in a graph. 

This is the standard algorithm for finding the strongly connected components in a graph.

It uses two indexes,
	
	1. disc[v]   determines the discovery time of a vertex
	
	2. low[v]    determines the low time for the vertex

Depth First search(DFS) is used for searching.
